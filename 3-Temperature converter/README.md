Features

Multi-Unit Conversions: Convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit,  (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit).
Real-Time Results: Displays converted values instantly as users enter a temperature or select a unit.
Input Validation: Checks for valid numeric inputs and shows error messages for invalid entries (e.g., "Invalid Input" for non-numbers).
Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly to desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Simple UI: Features input fields and dropdowns (or buttons) for selecting units, ensuring ease of use.
Keyboard Support (optional): Allows users to input temperatures via keyboard, if implemented.

Technologies Used

HTML: Structures the input fields, unit selectors, and output display.
CSS: Styles the app for a modern, clean look with responsive layouts and visual feedback (e.g., hover effects on buttons).
JavaScript: Manages conversion logic, processes user inputs, and updates the display dynamically.

Why These Technologies?

HTML: Creates a semantic and accessible structure for the input form, unit selectors (dropdowns or buttons), and result display.
CSS: Ensures a polished, responsive design with centered layouts and intuitive styling, making the app visually appealing across devices.
JavaScript: Handles the conversion formulas, validates inputs, and updates the UI in real-time for a smooth user experience.

How It Works

User Interface:
The app includes an input field for entering a temperature value and dropdowns (or buttons) to select the input and output units (Celsius, Fahrenheit).
A display area shows the converted temperature immediately after input or unit selection.


Conversion Logic:
JavaScript applies standard temperature conversion formulas:
Celsius to Fahrenheit: °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32
Fahrenheit to Celsius: °C = (°F - 32) × 5/9



Input validation ensures only valid numbers are processed, with error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., letters or symbols).


Example:
Input: 20 in Celsius, target unit Fahrenheit.
Output: 68°F.







No Dependencies Required:
The app uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, requiring no external libraries.



Usage

Open index.html in your browser.
Enter a temperature value (e.g., 20) in the input field.
Select the input unit (e.g., Celsius) and the target unit (e.g., Fahrenheit) using dropdowns or buttons.
View the converted value instantly (e.g., 68°F).
Test different units and values for conversions.
If an invalid input is entered (e.g., "abc"), an error message like "Invalid Input" appears.
