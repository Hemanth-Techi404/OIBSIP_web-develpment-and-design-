## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (×), and division (÷).
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Clear Functionality**: Includes a clear button to reset the calculator.
- **Real-Time Calculations**: Displays results instantly as users input numbers and operations.
- **Error Handling**: Prevents invalid inputs like dividing by zero.
- **Keyboard Support** (optional, if implemented): Perform calculations using keyboard inputs.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the calculator, including buttons and display.
- **CSS**: Styles the calculator for a modern, clean look with a grid layout for buttons.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for calculations, user input processing, and display updates.

### Why These Technologies?
- **HTML**: Simple and semantic markup to create the calculator's layout, like buttons for digits (0-9), operators (+, -, ×, ÷), and a display screen.
- **CSS**: Ensures the app is visually appealing and responsive, with hover effects on buttons and a centered layout.
- **JavaScript**: Manages dynamic behavior, such as capturing button clicks, performing calculations, and updating the display in real-time.

## How It Works
1. **User Interface**:
   - The calculator has a display area showing the current input and results.
   - Buttons are organized in a grid for digits (0-9), operators (+, -, ×, ÷), a clear button (C), and an equals button (=).
2. **Logic**:
   - JavaScript listens for button clicks or keyboard inputs.
   - Numbers and operators are stored as the user clicks buttons.
   - When the equals button is pressed, JavaScript evaluates the expression (e.g., `5 + 3`) and displays the result.
   - The clear button resets the display and stored values.
   - Error handling ensures invalid operations (like dividing by zero) show an error message like "Error".
